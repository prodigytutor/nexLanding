/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This file contains styles for our global components.
 * 
 * We use Tailwind CSS to generate utility classes. The "base" and "utilities"
 * layers are standard Tailwind CSS classes. The "components" layer is where
 * we define classes for our own components.
 * 
 * In this file, we're defining the styles for our buttons, which are our own
 * components. We're defining two classes: "btn-primary" and "btn-text".
 * 
 * The "btn-primary" class is used to style our primary button color. It sets the
 * background color to black and the text color to white.
 * 
 * The "btn-text" class is used to style our text-only buttons. It sets the text
 * color to black and removes the background color.
 * 
 * The "components" layer is defined using the "@layer components" directive.
 * This directive tells Tailwind CSS to generate utility classes for this layer.
 * 
 * The "@apply" directive is used to apply a set of utility classes to an element.
 * Here, we're applying a set of utility classes to our button components.
 * These utility classes set the padding, border-radius, font-weight, and
 * display properties of the button.
